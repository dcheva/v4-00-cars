extends FSMTransition
## A transition between two [FSMState]s in a [FiniteStateMachine].
##
## This is the base class for all transitions. To implement your logic you can
## override the [code]_on_transition[/code] method when extending the node's
## script.[br]
## To setup custom conditions you can override the is_valid method.[br]
## If you want to use events to trigger the transition, set
## [code]use_event[/code] to true and set the event property to the name
## of the event you want to listen for.


## Executed when the transition is taken.
